	<p>
        In 2013, PayPal India launched <strong>Start Tank Chennai</strong>, an innovation space for the next generation of startups in India. It is located within PayPalâ€™s India Development Center in Chennai.
        The initiative seeks to nurture and support the creation of a new generation of technology companies by offering them not just initial infrastructure and mentorship, direction and encouragement, but also a
        chance to work alongside some of the best minds in the field. PayPal has partnered with TiE Chennai and their mentor network to support the varying needs of the incubated startups.

           Start Tank, which is a part of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program of PayPal, provides a  cost and obligation-free environment for the selected
	  startups to evolve.
